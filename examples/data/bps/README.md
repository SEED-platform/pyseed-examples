The data have been removed from this repo. Use the data from here https://github.com/SEED-platform/seed/tree/BPS_data/seed/tests/data/bps. 

This repository will need to be checked out before running the `seed_bps.py` script.

This folder, however, still contains the mapping files needed to import the data.
